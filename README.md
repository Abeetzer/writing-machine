# writing-machine
This is my project on creating a drawing/writing machine. The ultimate goal was to use a CircuitScribe pen(which has conductive ink) in order to make homemade circuits using paper.

In the file system is an mp4 of the keyboard in its prototype form.

# Step 0:
download STL files using provided link on left hand side of github page

# Step 1:
download the code.

# Step 2:
 get an Arduino with two stepper motors and one servo motor for the pencil

 # Step 3:
 download the provided CAD files and 3D print or laser cut them.

 # step 4: 
 assemble it all 

# Step 5:
use an old version of Inkscape(provided in the repo) to turn any drawing into a Gcode file

# Step 6:
In the code folder, there is a processing and an Arduino sketch. The processing sketch feeds the Arduino sketch with the Gcode and gives the software a GUI. THe Arduino code turns the Gcode into steps or angles using basic trig functions.

# Step 7:
insert a drawing utensil of choice and watch the machine work!!
